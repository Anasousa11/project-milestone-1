Pebble Path Montessori Nursery Website 

📌 Purpose 

 The purpose of this website is to provide information regarding Pebble Path Montessori Nursery to parents and guardians. It includes an explanation of the Montessori teaching method/philosophy, images that captures the daily routine, testimonies from parents sharing the benefits of the nursery, and a contact page where you can apply or book a visit to see first-hand the facilities and staff. I designed this website with a very simple easy-to-navigate layout from the perspective of a parent who has looked for nurseries and visited different kinds from Montessori to a traditional nursery. 

💡 Value to Users 

- Allows users to quickly find nursery information without needing to call or visit in person. 

- Allows users to also get straight to booking a visit if you rather get a feel for the nursery instead of relying on online information and pictures. 

- Fully responsive, so it works on phones, tablets, and desktops.  

🎯 Target Audience 

- Parents of children aged 0–5 looking for a Montessori nursery. 

- Existing parents wanting updates or contact info.

- Expecting/local parents

🧭 Features 

- Navigation with menu items. 

- Responsive design using CSS Grid and media queries. 

- Accessible layout with good contrast, alt text, and readable fonts.

<strong>Planning</strong>

I began by identifying the purpose of the website: to inform parents that there are different teaching methods such as the Montessori method, how that looks like and the benefits. 

I sketched wireframes for the homepage, about page, and contact page using Balsamiq.

Decided on a calm and welcoming colour palette suitable for a nursery: 

<img width="436" alt="color-ss" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ae5b7d-62bb-4d37-8f77-c0af19fd3ec2" />


Chose clean, legible fonts to appear friendly and modern (Playfair Display, Laora, Quicksand, Zeyada, sour gummy, yesteryear) and a simple sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability.
